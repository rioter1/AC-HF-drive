# AC-HF-drive
Bachelors thesis (Delhi College of Engineering, Delhi University, 2008 batch) "Simulation and Mathematical Modelling of Vector Control Drive and Associated Parameters"

Simulink model for AC high frequency drive with Inverter/Converter circuit broken into simple pieces  

Below is the simulink model I did as my bachelor's thesis for a breakdown of an induction motor AC drive tool avaliable in Simulink into base components.

In conclusion, the thesis showed a near-perfect breakdown of the AC drive avalaible in simulink into simple understandable blocks. 

The comparison with the ideal induction motor characteristics and one those obtained by the my model are demonstrated in the thesis attached.
